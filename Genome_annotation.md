## How to use geneious for genome annotation

This tutorial mainly documented how to use the transfer Annotation function on Geneious. I will include all the screen shot to guide your through the entire process.<br>

Prerequisite
============

1.[Download Geneious](https://www.geneious.com/download/) <br>
2.reference fasta file (the file you want to add annotation) <br>
3.gtf and fasta file for annoated sequence, ideally you want to find the cloest sequence to your reference. <br>

Tutorial
========
1.Import both gtf and the fasta in to geneious(make sure select them at the same time)
2.Import reference fasta in to geneious. (I am using Influenza A as a example)
3.choose the gene segment and click alignment - geneious alignment

4.after you alignment the gene segment,click the alignment and choose the reference set as reference sequence

5.on the right side, click transfer annotation, and set the similiarity to 85%(you can change this number) until you saw there is annotation on your referenece genome. click apply

5.Next you want to save the changes and apply changes to orginals <br>
