## How to use geneious for genome annotation

This tutorial mainly documented how to use the transfer Annotation function on Geneious. I will include all the screen shot to guide your through the entire process.<br>

Prerequisite
============

1.[Download Geneious](https://www.geneious.com/download/) <br>
2.reference fasta file (the file you want to add annotation) <br>
3.gtf and fasta file for annoated sequence, ideally you want to find the cloest sequence to your reference. <br>

Tutorial
========
1.Import both gtf and the fasta in to geneious(make sure select them at the same time)
2.Import reference fasta in to geneious. (I am using Influenza A as a example)
3.choose the gene segment and click alignment - geneious align
